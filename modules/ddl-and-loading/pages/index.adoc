:description: An overview of the database definition language.

The GSQL (R) Graph Database Language is more than just a query language. It also serves as a DDL (Database Definition Language).

You use the DDL syntax to define the _schema_, the blueprint for data elements in your database and how they relate to one another: _vertex types_, _edge types_, and _graphs_. A graph is a collection of vertex and edge types.

The DDL documentation is split into two logical parts:

* xref:defining-a-graph-schema.adoc[Defining a graph schema]
* xref:modifying-a-graph-schema.adoc[Modifying a graph schema]
