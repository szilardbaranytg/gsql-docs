= What sets GSQL apart

GSQL is the choice for fast and scalable graph operations and analytics.
GSQLâ€™s similarity to SQL, high-level syntax, Turing completeness, and built-in parallelism brings faster performance, faster development and the ability to describe any algorithm.

== Designed for analytics
GSQL is designed for complex graph analytics.
By taking advantage of a unique feature of the GSQL query language - accumulators - users can leverage TigerGraph's Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) capability without the pain and fuss traditionally associated with parallel programming.


== Turing-complete
GSQL is Turing-complete with full support for imperative and procedural programming, ideal for algorithmic computation.
The Turing completeness of the language, especially with the conventional xref:querying:control-flow-statements.adoc[control flow statements], allows users to describe any algorithm with GSQL.

TigerGraph offers an xref:graph-ml:intro:index.adoc[open-source data science library of algorithms] implemented entirely in GSQL, including xref:graph-ml:community-algorithms:louvain.adoc[Louvain algorithm for community detection] and the xref:graph-ml:centrality-algorithms:pagerank.adoc[PageRank algorithm], demonstrating GSQL's ability to describe complex algorithms.

== Fast loading and querying
Data loading procedures and queries written in GSQL take full advantage of TigerGraph's MPP capability, enabling blazing-fast data ingestion as well as querying.

In a link:https://www.datanami.com/2022/04/20/tigergraph-releases-new-benchmark-report/[benchmark test], TigerGraph used the Data Benchmark Council (LDBC) Social Network Benchmark (SNB) Scale Factor 30k dataset.
The results show that TigerGraph can run deep-link OLAP style queries on *36 TB* of raw data with 73 billion vertices and 534 billion edges, returning results in a few minutes or less.

== SQL-like
GSQL features an SQL-like syntax that reduces the learning curve for SQL programmers.

The following are two queries that retrieve a list of products in alphabetical order.
We can see the similarities between the two languages especially in the `SELECT` statements:

|===
|SQL |GSQL

a|
[source,sql]
----
SELECT p.*
FROM Product p
ORDER BY p.ProductName;
----
a|
[source,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY products_abc() {
  products = {Product.*};

  results =
    SELECT p
    FROM products:p
    ORDER BY p.productName;

  PRINT results;
}
