= GSQL Implementation of LDBC SNB Benchmark Queries

We will use the xref:https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.02299.pdf[LDBC SNB Benchmark workload] to illustrate the GSQL syntax with many examples. Studying these GSQL examples will help you master GSQL quickly.

== DDL

NOTE: we replicated the dynamic vertex types 3 times, creating Comment1 ~ Comment3, Person1 ~  Person3, Post1 ~ Post3,
and Forum1 ~ Forum3. These derived schema will help us to illustrate how to specify multiple-pairs of source and target
in a single edge type.
