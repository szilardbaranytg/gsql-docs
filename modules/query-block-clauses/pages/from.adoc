= FROM Clause

The `FROM` clause describes a vertex pattern, or a single hop or a multi-hop path pattern.

A hop or step consists of going from a starting set of vertices, crossing over a set of their edges, to an ending set of vertices.

If you project all the vertex or edge variables in the `FROM` clause into one line, they form a binding table.

For best performance, we recommend always use 1-hop or vertex pattern. And select the vertex variable that you want to drive the next step. Use the assigned vertex set variable to drive the next query block.

*Syntax:*
[source,gsql]
----
fromClause := FROM  pathPattern

pathPattern :=  sourceVertexSet ["-" "(" pathEdgePattern ")" "-" stepVertexSet]*

*Example:*
[source,gsql]

USE GRAPH financialGraph

CREATE OR REPLACE DISTRIBUTED QUERY mainQuery() {


  //select vertex set p, assign it to S1
  S1 = SELECT p
       FROM Phone:p
       WHERE p.number in ("111", "222");
  //output S1
  PRINT S1;


  //Use S1 to drive another 2-hop pattern
  //select target vertex set c, assign it to S2
  S2 = SELECT c
       FROM S1 -(hasPhone)-Account:c-(Transfer>)-Account:b;

  //output S2
  PRINT S2;
