= GSQL SERVER REST API
:description: Overview of GSQL SERVER's REST API.
:pp: {plus}{plus}
:page-aliases: tigergraph-server:API:intro.adoc, tigergraph-server:api:intro.doc

This user guide provides information on how to engage with our REST APIs: the introduction section explains how to send requests, pass parameters, and format request bodies, while xref:gsql-endpoints.adoc[] describes in detail each endpoint and its input and output.

To submit a request, send an HTTP request to the NGINX server or the GSQL server.
By default, the GSQL server listens for requests at port 8123 and the NGINX server listens on port 14240.
A request must include the following specifications:

* The request method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`)
* The endpoint address
* Any required or optional request parameters in URL encoding
* For `POST` requests, a data payload (i.e., request body) in JSON encoding unless otherwise specified
* In some cases, request header parameters

For requests sent to the GSQL server, TigerGraph user credentials must be provided for the request to be accepted.


== `curl` options

Request examples in this guide are made using https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html[`curl`]. Below is a list of `curl` options used in our code examples:

* `-d <data>`
 ** Sends the specified data in a `POST` request to the HTTP server in the same way that a browser does when a user has filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This will cause curl to pass the data to the server using the content-type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
 ** If the data starts with the character @, the rest should specify the filepath from which to read the data. The command `curl -d @foobar` will read data from a file named `foobar`.
* `--data-binary <data>`
 ** Sends data with a `POST` request exactly as specified with no extra processing.
* `--fail`
 ** Makes curl fail silently (no output at all) on server errors.
 ** This is mostly done to enable scripts etc. to better deal with failed attempts. In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document stating so (which often also describes why and more). This flag will prevent curl from outputting that and return error 22.
* `-H <header>`
 ** Extra header to include in the request when sending HTTP to a server. Any number of extra headers can be specified.
 ** TigerGraph APIs use headers to specify xref:API:index.adoc#_size_and_time_limits[size and time limits], as well as to provide RESTPP xref:authentication.adoc#_restpp_server_requests[authentication] tokens.
* `-s`
 ** Silent or quiet mode. Don't show a progress meter or error messages. It will still output the data you ask for, potentially even to the terminal/stdout unless you redirect it.
* `-u <user:password>`
 ** Submits the specified user name and password for server authentication.
* `-X <request_method>`
 ** Specifies a custom request method to use when communicating with the HTTP server. If this option is not used, curl will make a `GET` request by default.
