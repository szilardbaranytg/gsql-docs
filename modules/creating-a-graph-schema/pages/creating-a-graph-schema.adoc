= Create A Graph Schema

Before loading data into a graph database, you need to define a graph schema. This section shows how to create a graph schema using vertex types and edge types.

== Sample Graph
To effectively illustrate the concepts needed to create a graph schema, we will create an example graph schema modeling the data in the sample graph below in the following articles. The graph consists of two types of elements:

* **Vertices**: Represented by circles. These are the nodes or entities in your graph.
* **Edges**: Represented by lines. Each connects a pair of vertices and represents a relationship between them.

Both vertices and edges have structured types, similar to how tables define records in relational databases.
Vertex types define the structure of vertices, and edge types define the structure of edges.
Bold labels in each graph element show the names of each type. Graph elements with the same color share the same type.
