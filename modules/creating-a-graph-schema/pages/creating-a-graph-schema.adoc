= Create A Graph Schema

Before loading data into a graph database, you need to define a graph schema. This section shows how to create a graph schema using vertex types and edge types.

== Sample Graph
We will use a sample graph to illustrate the concepts. In the figure below, the graph consists of two types of elements:

* **Vertices**: Represented by circles. These are the nodes or entities in your graph.
* **Edges**: Represented by lines. Each connects a pair of vertices and represents a relationship between them.

Both vertices and edges have structured types, similar to how tables define records in relational databases.
Vertex types define the structure of vertices, and edge types define the structure of edges.
Bold labels in each graph element show the names of each type. Graph elements with the same color share the same type.
