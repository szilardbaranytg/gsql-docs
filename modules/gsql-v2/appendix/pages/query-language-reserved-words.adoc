= Query Language Keywords & Reserved Words
:page-aliases: querying:appendix-query/query-language-reserved-words.adoc

The page lists the reserved words and non-reserved keywords used in the GSQL query language.

There is a separate list for xref:appendix:keywords-and-reserved-words.adoc[].
The compiler will reject the use of a Reserved Word as a user-defined identifier.

== Reserved words

The following words are reserved for use by the GSQL query language.
That is a query may not use any of these words for a user-defined identifier
 such as the name of a local variable or a local `TUPLE` type.
Some of them come from C++, which is a dependency for GSQL.

You should also not use words from the following lists to name vertex or edge types.
While GSQL does not raise an error when you define the types, you will not be able to reference the types in a query.
