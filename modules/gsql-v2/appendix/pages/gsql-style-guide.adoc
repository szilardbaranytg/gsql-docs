= GSQL Style Guide
:description: TigerGraph's Style guide for writing GSQL.


This page details TigerGraphâ€™s style guide for writing GSQL.
The purpose of the style guide is to make code easy to read and achieve lower cost of maintenance.

== General
* Always write keywords and reserved words in all caps. You can find a list of keywords and reserved words in xref:query-language-reserved-words.adoc[] and xref:keywords-and-reserved-words.adoc[].
* If you are storing GSQL statements in a separate file, use the file extension `.gsql`.

== Naming
Identifiers are categorized into two broad classes:

* Schema object _types_ (graph, vertex, edge, and tuple type).
* Instances.

Schema types are analogous to classes in an object-oriented language.
Schema object types names have their initial letter capitalized, connected by underscore; instances use snake case, with additional specifications for accumulators.

Detailed identifier naming conventions are described in the following table:

[cols=",a,"]
|===
|Identifier type |Style |Example

|Instances (This includes any variable one can declare in a loading job or query not otherwise specified in the table)
|Use snake case: lowercase, letters connected by underscore
a|* `batch_number`
* `v_type`


|Non-collection accumulators (`SumAccum`, `MinAccum`, `MaxAccum` etc.)
|* Use snake case
* Start with the aggregation type such as sum unless there is an excellent semantic alternative
|
``@num_fraudsters``footnote:[If you want to use `num` to refer to a quantity, always put it at the beginning. For example, use `num_students` to refer to the number of students instead of `students_num`]

|Collection accumulator
|* Use snake case
* End with container type

a|* `@top_result_list`
* `@@property_map`
* `@neighbor_set`


|Vertex type name
|Capitalize initial letters and connect words with underscores.
a|* `Person`
* `Medical_Condition`


|Edge type name
|Capitalize initial letters and connect words with underscores.
a|* `Diagnosed_By`

|Vertex and edge attribute name
|Use snake case.
|`CREATE VERTEX Genre (PRIMARY_ID genre_id STRING, genre_name STRING)`

|Graph name
|Capitalize initial letters and connect words with underscores.
a|* `Social_Net`

|Tuple type name
|Capitalize initial letters and connect words with underscores.
a|* `Vertex_Score`
* `Key_Pair`


|Query and loading job name
|Use snake case.
a|* `match_users`
* `suggest_products`
* `tg_degree_cent`
|===

== Spacing

=== Block indentation
Indent the body of a block by 4 spaces.
A block is a syntactic structure which may contain multiple statements.
This includes queries, `SELECT`, `IF/ELSE`, `CASE WHEN/THEN`, `FOREACH`, and `WHILE`.
If the body of `ACCUM` or `POST-ACCUM` contains multiple clauses, then use indentation also.
Use spaces instead of tabs, because tab size can vary.

[cols="1h,5a"]
|===
|Recommended |
[.wrap,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY hello(VERTEX<Person> p) {
    Start = {p};
    Result = SELECT tgt
        FROM Start:s -(Friendship:e)- Person:tgt;
        PRINT Result;
}
----

|Not recommended

|
[.wrap,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY hello(VERTEX<Person> p) {
Start = {p};
Result = SELECT tgt
         FROM Start:s -(Friendship:e)- Person:tgt;
PRINT Result;
}
----
|===


=== Line length
Lines should be short enough so that they display without scrolling and can be printed without anything being cut off.
If a line is more than 80 characters, it should be split into multiple lines. The additional lines should be indented, but by 2 spaces only, to show that they are a continuation of the previous line.

==== Recommended
[,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY hello(VERTEX<Person> p) {
    start = {p};
    result = SELECT tgt
        FROM start:s -(Friendship:e)- Person:tgt; /* This is a long
          comment and it is split into multiple lines. */
        PRINT Result;
}
----

==== Not recommended

[,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY hello(VERTEX<Person> p) {
    Start = {p};
    Result = SELECT tgt
        FROM Start:s -(Friendship:e)- Person:tgt; // This is a long comment that spans over a hundred characters. It really should be split into multiple lines instead of crowding one line
    PRINT Result;
}
----

=== Keyword justification
In a `SELECT` block, line up the keywords `FROM`, `SAMPLE`, `WHERE`, `ACCUM`, `POST-ACCUM`, `HAVING`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`.

[cols="1h,5a"]
|===
|Recommended |
[,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY active_members (INT activity_threshold) FOR GRAPH Social_Net {
    SumAccum<INT> @activity_amount;
    start = {Person.*};
    result = SELECT v FROM start:v -(:e)- Post:tgt
        ACCUM v.@activity_amount +=1
        HAVING v.@activity_amount >= activity_threshold; <1>
    PRINT result;
}
----
<1> `ACCUM` and `HAVING` are lined up in the `SELECT` block.


|Not recommended

|
[,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY active_members(INT activity_threshold) FOR GRAPH Social_Net
{
    SumAccum<INT> @activity_amount;
    start = {Person.*};
    result = SELECT v FROM start:v -(_>:e)- Post:tgt
      ACCUM v.@activity_amount +=1
        HAVING v.@activity_amount >= activity_threshold; <1>
    PRINT result;
}
----
<1> `ACCUM` and `HAVING` are not lined up in this example.
This is not recommended.
|===


== Comments

* Use `//` for single line and inline comments.
* Use `/\*` at the start and `*/` at the end of multiline comments, with the interior comment lines indented.
* Do not use `#`.

[cols="1h,5a"]

[.wrap,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY active_male_members() FOR GRAPH Social_Net
{
    /* Compute the total post activity for each male person.
    Because the gender of the vertex does not change, evaluating whether the person vertex is male before (WHERE) the ACCUM clause or after (HAVING) the ACCUM clause does not change the result.
However, if the condition in the HAVING clause could change within the ACCUM clause, these statements would produce different results. */ <1>

    SumAccum<INT> @activity_amount;
    start = {Person.*};

    // The following statements produce equivalent results <2>
    result1 = SELECT v FROM start:v -(Posted>:e)- Post:tgt
        WHERE v.gender == "Male"
        ACCUM v.@activity_amount +=1;

    result2 = SELECT v FROM start:v -(Posted>:e)- Post:tgt
        ACCUM v.@activity_amount +=1
        HAVING v.gender == "Male";

    PRINT result1;
    PRINT result2;
}
----
<1> Multi-line comments are put in `/* */`.
<2> Single-line comments are put after `//`.

CREATE QUERY active_male_members() FOR GRAPH Social_Net

    PRINT result2;
}
----
<1> Multi-line comments are put in multiple double forward slashes `//`.
This is not recommended.
<2> Single-line comments are put after the hashtag symbol `#`.
This is not recommended and will not be supported by the upcoming https://www.gqlstandards.org/[GQL standard].
