:page-aliases: pattern-matching/adv/readme.adoc, pattern-matching/adv/README.adoc

This section includes some advanced features related to pattern matching.
It includes using the `PER` clause to fine control the `ACCUM` execution, data modification language (DML) support in pattern matching, and the conjunctive pattern match syntax which allows multiple patterns in one `FROM` clause.
We dedicate a subsection for each topic.
