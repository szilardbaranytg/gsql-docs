= Repeating a 1-Hop Pattern

A common pattern is the two-step "Friend of a Friend".

This is related to the question "Do I know any famous people?"
Even if you aren't friends with any famous people, at least one of _your friends'_ friends might be famous.
That's a one-hop pattern, repeated twice.

In terms of data throughput on a network, you can also ask "If everyone who receives a message passes it along to everyone else they know, how many entities will receive it?"

GSQL pattern matching makes it easy to express such variable-length patterns which repeat a single hop.
Everything else stays the same as introduced in the previous section, except we append an asterisk (or _Kleene star_) and an optional _min..max_ range to an edge pattern.

* (E*)  means edge type E repeats any number of times (including zero)
* (E*1..3) means edge type E occurs one to three times.

Below are more illustrative examples:

* *1-hop star pattern -- repetition of an edge pattern 0 or more times*
 .. `FROM X:x -(E*)- Y:y`
 .. `FROM X:x -(F>*)- Y:y`
 .. `FROM X:x -(<G*)- Y:y`
 .. `FROM X:x -(_*)- Y:y`
  *** Any undirected edge can be chosen at each repetition.
 .. `FROM X:x -(_>*)- Y:y`
  *** Any right-directed edge can be chosen at each repetition.
 .. `FROM X:x -(<_*)- Y:y`
  *** Any left-directed edge can be chosen at each repetition.
 .. `FROM X:x -((E|F>|<G)*)- Y:y`
  *** Either E, F> or <G can be chosen at each repetition.
* *1-hop star pattern with bounds*
 .. `FROM X:x -(E*2..)- Y:y`
  *** Lower bounds only. There is a chain of at least 2 E edges.
 .. `FROM X:x -(F>*..3)- Y:y`
  *** Upper bounds only. There is a chain of between 0 and 3 F edges.
 .. `FROM X:x -(<G*3..5)- Y:y`
  *** Both Lower and Upper bounds. There is a chain of 3 to 5 G edges.
 .. `FROM X:x -((E|F>|<G)*3)- Y:y`
  *** Exact bound. There is a chain of exactly 3 edges, where each edge is either E, F>, or <G.


=== Remarks

==== No alias allowed for edge with Kleene star

An edge alias may not be used when a Kleene star is used. The reason is that when there are a variable number of edges, we cannot associate or bind the alias to a specific edge in the pattern.

==== Shortest path semantics

When an edge is repeated with a Kleene star, only the shortest matching occurrences are selected. See the example below:

image::screen-shot-2019-05-19-at-2.33.35-am.png[Figure 2 Shortest Path Illustration.]

In Figure 2,  or Pattern `1 -(E>*)- 4`, any of the following paths reach 4 from 1.

* 1->2->3->4
* 1->2->3->5->6->2->3->4
* any path that goes through the cycle 2->3->5->6->2 two or more times and jumps out at 3.

The first path is shorter than the rest; it is considered the only match.

== Examples of Variable Hop Queries

In this tutorial, we will use the Interpreted Mode for GSQL so that we can skip the INSTALL step and run a query as soon as we create it.
These one-step interpreted queries are unnamed (anonymous) and parameterless.

You can copy any of the shown GSQL scripts to a file with the file extension `.gsql` and invoke it in a Linux shell to see the results.
