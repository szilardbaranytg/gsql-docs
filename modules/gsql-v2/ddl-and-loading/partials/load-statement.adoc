== Load statement

A `LOAD` statement describes how to parse a data line into column values (tokens), and then describes how the values should be used to create a new vertex or edge instance.

One `LOAD` statement can be used to generate multiple vertices or edges, each vertex or edge having its own _destination clause_, as shown below.
Additionally, two or more LOAD statements may refer to the same input data file.
In this case, the GSQL loader will merge their operations so that both of their operations are executed in a single pass through the data file.

The `LOAD` statement has many options. This reference guide provides examples of key features and options. Tutorials such as xref:tutorials:gsql-101/[GSQL 101] provide additional solution- and application-oriented examples.

Different `LOAD` statement types have different rules for the xref:creating-a-loading-job.adoc#_using_clause[`USING` clause]; see the `USING` clause section below for specifics.

=== Syntax

[source,ebnf]
----
LOAD [ filepath_string|filevar|TEMP_TABLE table_name ]
     destination_clause [, destination_clause ]*
     [ TAGS clause ]
     [ USING clause ];
----

`filevar` must have been previously defined in a `DEFINE FILENAME` statement.

`filepath_string` must satisfy the same rules given above in the `DEFINE FILENAME` section.

=== Destination clause

A _destination clause_ describes how the tokens from a data source should be used to construct one of three types of data objects: a vertex, an edge, or a row in a <<_temp_table_and_flatten_functions, temporary table>> (`TEMP_TABLE`).
This section describes destination clauses for loading to vertices and edges.

.Vertex Destination Clause
[source,gsql]
----
TO VERTEX vertex_type_name VALUES (id_expr [, attr_expr]*)
    [WHERE conditions]
----

////
.Vertex Destination Clause
[source,gsql]
----
TO VERTEX vertex_type_name VALUES (id_expr [, attr_expr]*)
    [WHERE conditions] [OPTION (options)]
----
////

.Edge Destination Clause
[source,gsql]
----
TO EDGE edge_type_name VALUES (source_id_expr [source_type_expr],
                               target_id_expr [target_type_expr]
                               [, attr_expr]*)
    [WHERE conditions]
----

////
.Edge Destination Clause
[source,gsql]
----
TO EDGE edge_type_name VALUES (source_id_expr [source_type_expr],
                               target_id_expr [target_type_expr]
                               [, attr_expr]*)
    [WHERE conditions] [OPTION (options)]
----
////

For the `TO VERTEX` and `TO EDGE` destination clauses, the following rules for its parameters apply:

* The `vertex_type_name` or `edge_type_name` must match the name of a vertex or edge type previously defined in a `CREATE VERTEX` or `CREATE UNDIRECTED|DIRECTED EDGE` statement.
* The values in the value list_(`id_expr`, `attr_expr1`, `attr_expr2`,...)_ are assigned to the ID(s) and attributes of a new vertex or edge instance, in the same order in which they are listed in the `CREATE` statement.
* `id_expr` obeys the same attribute rules as `attr_expr`, except that only `attr_expr` can use the reducer function, which is introduced later.
* For edge clauses, the `source_id_expr` and `target_id_expr` can each optionally be followed by a `source_type_expr` and `target_type_expr`, respectively. The `source_type_expr` and `target_type_expr` must evaluate to one of the allowed endpoint vertex types for the given edge type.
By specifying the vertex type, this tells the loader what id types to expect. This may be important when the edge type is defined to accept more than one type of source/target vertex.


[CAUTION]
====
To support fast, out-of-order loading, *if one or both of the endpoint vertices of an edge do not yet exist, the loader will create vertices with the necessary IDs and default attribute values.*
If the vertex data is loaded later, it will be automatically merged with the automatically created vertices.

The user can disable this feature and perform regular referential integrity checking by setting the `VERTEX_MUST_EXIST` option to `true`.
====

=== Examples

Suppose we have the following vertex and edge types:

[source,gsql]
----
CREATE VERTEX Person (pid STRING PRIMARY KEY, birthdate DATETIME)
CREATE VERTEX Company (cid INT PRIMARY KEY, industry STRING)
CREATE DIRECTED EDGE Visit (FROM Person, TO Person
                          | FROM Person, TO Company, year INT)
----

==== Vertex loading
The `Person` vertex type has a primary ID `pid` and an attribute `birthdate`.
If we have the following CSV file with two columns:

[,csv]
----
Name,DOB
Sam,1994-05-01
Chris,1985-12-25
Pat,1996-11-13
Joe,1975-11-02
Taylor,1988-04-25
----

If we want to use a person's name as their primary ID, and load the DOB column into their `birthdate` attribute, we can use the following `LOAD` statement:

[,gsql]
----
LOAD file1 TO VERTEX Person VALUES ($"Name", $"DOB") USING HEADER = "TRUE"
----

==== Edge loading

A `Visit` edge can connect two `Person` vertices or a `Person` to a `Company`.
A `Person` has a string ID, while a Company has an `INT` ID.
Then suppose the `Visit` edge source data comes from a single CSV file, containing both variants of edges.
Note that the 2nd column (`$1`) contains either `Person` or `Company`, and that the 3rd column (`$2`) contains either a string or an integer.

[source,csv]
----
Sam,Person,Joe,2012
Sam,Company,4057,2017
Chris,Company,9401,2016
Pat,Person,Taylor,2020
----

Using the optional `target_type_expr` field, we can load both variants of the `Visit` edge with a single clause.

[source,gsql]
----
LOAD file2 TO EDGE Visit VALUES ($0, $2 $1, $3) USING SEPARATOR=",";
----

[WARNING]
====
*Known issue*: Prior to v3.9.2, when loading data into edge types defined with multiple `FROM-TO` vertex pairs, the load statement must include a `USING` clause, even if all options are default.
"Multiple `FROM-TO` vertex pairs" means something like this: `CREATE DIRECTED EDGE Member_Of (FROM Person, TO Org | FROM Org, TO Org, joined DATETIME)`
====

=== WHERE clause

The `WHERE` clause is an optional clause.
The `WHERE` clause's condition is a boolean expression.
The expression may use column token variables, token functions, and operators which are described below.
The expression is evaluated for each input data line. If the condition is true, then the vertex or edge instance is loaded into the graph store.
If the condition is false, then this instance is skipped. Note that all attribute values are treated as string values in the expression, so the type conversion functions `to_int()` and `to_float()`, which are described below, are provided to enable numerical conditions.

==== Operators in the WHERE Clause

The GSQL Loader language supports most of the standard arithmetic, relational, and boolean operators found in C{pp}. Standard operator precedence applies, and parentheses provide the usual override of precedence.

Arithmetic Operators:: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `{caret}`. Numeric operators can be used to express complex operations between numeric types. Just as in ordinary mathematical expressions, parentheses can be used to define a group and to modify the order of precedence.

[WARNING]
====
Because computers can only store approximations for most `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT` type values, testing these data types for exact equality or inequality is not recommended.
Instead, one should allow for an acceptable amount of error.
The following example checks if `$0` is equal to `5`, with an error of 0.00001 permitted:

[source,gsql]
----
WHERE to_float($0) BETWEEN 5-0.00001 AND 5+0.00001
----

====

Relational Operators:: `<`, `>`, `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=`.  Comparisons can be performed between two numeric values or between two string values.

Predicate Operators::
`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`::: operators are the same as in SQL. They can be used to combine multiple conditions together.  E.g., _$0 < "abc" AND $1 > "abc"_ selects the rows with the first token less than "abc" and the second token greater than "abc".  E.g., _NOT $1 < "abc"_ selects the rows with the second token greater than or equal to "abc".
`IS NUMERIC`:::  `<token> IS NUMERIC` returns true if `<token>` is in numeric format.
Numeric format include integers, decimal notation, and exponential notation.
Specifically, `IS NUMERIC` is true if token matches the following regular expression: `(+/-) ? [0-9] + (.[0-9]) ? [0-9] * ((e/E)(+/-) ? [0-9] +) ?`.
Any leading space and trailing space is skipped, but no other spaces are allowed.
For example, `$0 IS NUMERIC` checks whether the first token is in numeric format.
`IS EMPTY`:::  `<token> IS EMPTY` returns true if `<token>` is an empty string.
For example, `$1 IS EMPTY` checks whether the second token is empty.
`IN` ::: `<token> IN ( <set_of_values> )` returns true if `<token>` is equal to one member of a set of specified values.
The values may be string or numeric types.
For example, `$2 IN ("abc", "def", "lhm")` tests whether the third token equals one of the three strings in the given set.
For example, `to_int($3) IN (10, 1, 12, 13, 19)` tests whether the fourth token equals one of the specified five numbers.
`BETWEEN ... AND`:::  `<token> BETWEEN <lower_val> AND <upper_val>` returns true if `<token>` is within the specified range, inclusive of the endpoints. The values may be string or numeric types.
For example, `$4 BETWEEN "abc" AND "def"` checks whether the fifth token is greater than or equal to "abc" and also less than or equal to "def";
`to_float($5) BETWEEN 1 AND 100.5` checks whether the sixth token is greater than or equal to 1.0 and less than or equal to 100.5.

[[token-functions-in-where-clause]]
==== Token functions in the WHERE clause

The GSQL loading language provides several built-in functions for the `WHERE` clause.

The token functions in the WHERE clause and those token functions used for attribute expression are different. They cannot be used interchangeably.

=== `TAGS` clause (Deprecated)

IMPORTANT: Tag-based Vertex-Level Access Control is deprecated as of October 2023. This feature will be completely removed in v4.0.

The `TAGS` clause specifies the tags to be applied to the vertices loaded by the `LOAD` statement.

[source,gsql]
----
TAGS "(" tag_name (, tag_name)* ")" BY [ OR | OVERWRITE ]
----

If a `LOAD` statement has a `TAGS` clause, it will tag the vertices with the tags specified in the `TAGS` clause.
Before vertices can be loaded and tagged with a `LOAD` statement, the vertex type must first be xref:modifying-a-graph-schema.adoc#_alter_vertex_edge[marked as taggable], and xref:ddl-and-loading:modifying-a-graph-schema.adoc#_add_tag[the tags must be defined].

Users have two options when it comes to how to merge tags if the target vertices exist in the graph:

* `BY OR`: Add the new tags to the existing set of tags.
* `BY OVERWRITE`: Overwrite existing tags with the new tags.

[#_using_clause]
=== `USING` clause

A `USING` clause contains one or more optional parameter value pairs:

[source,ebnf]
----
USING parameter=value [,parameter=value]*
----

[WARNING]
====
If multiple `LOAD` statements use the same source (the same file path, the same temporary data table, or the same file variable), the `USING` clauses in these `LOAD` statements must be the same.
Therefore, we recommend that if multiple destination clauses share the same source, put all of these destination clauses into the same `LOAD` statement.
====

[width="100%",cols="1,4,1",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter | Description |Allowed values
|`SEPARATOR`
|Specifies the special character that separates tokens
(columns) in the data file.

a|
Any single ASCII character.

Default: comma `,`

* `\t for tab`
* `\xy` for ASCII decimal code `xy`

|`EOL`
|Specifies the end-of-line character.
a|
Any ASCII sequence

Default: `\n`(system-defined newline character or character
sequence)

|`QUOTE`
a|Specifies explicit boundary markers for string tokens,
either single or double quotation marks.

The parser will not treat separator characters found within a pair of quotation marks as a separator.
For example, if the parsing conditions are `QUOTE="double", SEPARATOR=","`, the comma in `"Leonard,Euler"` will not separate Leonard and Euler into separate tokens.

* If `QUOTE` is not declared, quotation marks are treated as ordinary characters.
* If `QUOTE` is declared, but a string does not contain a matching pair of quotation marks, then the string is treated as if `QUOTE` is not declared.
* Only the string inside the first pair of quote (from left to right) marks are loaded. For example `QUOTE="double"`, the string `a"b"c"d"e` will be loaded as b.
* There is no escape character in the loader, so the only way to include quotation marks within a string is for the string body to use one type of quote (single or double) and to declare the other type as the string boundary marker.
a|
* `"single"` for `'`
* `"double"` for `"`

|`HEADER`
a|
Whether the data file's first line is a header line.

The header assigns names to the columns.

The `LOAD` statement must refer to an actual file with a valid header.

a|
`"true"`, `"false"`.
Both values are strings and must be enclosed in double quotes.

Default is `"false"`

|`USER_DEFINED_HEADER`
|Specifies the name of the header variable, when a
header has been defined in the loading job, rather than in the data file
|The variable name in the preceding `DEFINE HEADER` statement

|`REJECT_LINE_RULE`
|If the filter expression evaluates to true, then do
not use this input data line.
Not supported in a xref:tigergraph-server:data-loading:index.adoc[ loading job].
|name of filter from a preceding `DEFINE
INPUT_LINE_FILTER` statement

|`JSON_FILE`
|Whether each line is a json
object (see xref:creating-a-loading-job.adoc#_loading_json_data[Loading JSON Data] below for more details)
a|
`"true"`, `"false"`

Default is `"false"`

|`NEW_VERTEX_ONLY`
a|
If true, treat vertices as insert-only.
If the input data refers to a
vertex which already exists, do not update it.

If false, upsert vertices.

a|
`"true"`, `"false"`

Default is `"false"`

a|
`VERTEX_MUST_EXIST`

|If true, only insert or update an edge if both endpoint vertices
already exist.
If false, always insert new edges, creating endpoint
vertices as needed, using given id and default values for other
parameters.
a|
`"true"`, `"false"`

Default is `"false"`
|===

[#_loading_json_data]
=== Loading JSON data

When the USING option `JSON_FILE="true"` is used, the loader loads JSON objects instead of tabular data.
A JSON object is an unordered set of key/value pairs, where each value may itself be an array or object, leading to nested structures.A colon separates each key from its value, and a comma separates items in a collection.

*The JSON loader requires that each input line has exactly one JSON object (see https://jsonlines.org/[JSON lines].*

The JSON loader uses JSON values as tokens, that is, the second part of each JSON key/value pair.
In a GSQL loading job, a JSON field is identified by a dollar sign `$` followed by the colon-separated sequence of nested key names to reach the value from the top level.
For example, given the JSON object `{"abc":{"def": "this_value"}}`, the identifier `$"abc":"def"` is used to access `"this_value"`.The double quotes are mandatory.

An example is shown below:

=== Loading Parquet data

TigerGraph can load data from Parquet files using our loader.
For more details on how to set up a Kafka data streaming connector and loading jobs, see xref:tigergraph-server:data-loading:data-loading-overview.adoc[].

CAUTION: When loading Parquet data, INT96 data types are not supported.
If your data source uses INT96 data types, the corresponding attribute in your graph will be left empty.  

TigerGraph uses the JSON loading functionality to read data from Parquet files, so the xref:creating-a-loading-job.adoc#_loading_json_data[JSON specific information] in the previous section applies.

In order to load Parquet data, you need to:

. Specify `"file.reader.type": "parquet"` in the S3 file configuration file or argument
. Specify `JSON_FILE="true"` in the USING clause of the LOAD statements
. Refer to JSON keys (≈ Parquet "column names") instead of column numbers

You should consider adding `USING EOF="true"` to your `RUN LOADING JOB` statement to explicitly indicate to the loading job to stop after consuming all data from the Parquet source, not to expect further entries.

An example of a Parquet loading setup is shown below:

[source,gsql]
----
CREATE DATA_SOURCE S3 s3ds = "{\"file.reader.settings.fs.s3a.access.key\":\"myaccesskey\",\"file.reader.settings.fs.s3a.secret.key\":\"mysecretkey\"}" FOR GRAPH companyGraph

CREATE LOADING JOB parquet_load FOR GRAPH companyGraph {

    DEFINE FILENAME f = "$s3ds:{\"file.uris\": \"s3://mybucket/mydata.parquet\", \"file.reader.type\": \"parquet\"}";

    LOAD f
      TO VERTEX members VALUES($"members", $"members") USING JSON_FILE="true";
}
