= Comments
:pp: {plus}{plus}

A comment is a section of text that is ignored by the language parser; its purpose is to provide information to human readers.
The comment markers follow the conventions used in C{pp} and SQL:

* Single-line or partial-line comments begin with `//` and end at the end of the line (with the newline character).
* Multi-line comment blocks begin with `/\*` and end with `*/`
