= Query Language Syntax Versions
:description: Summary of the differences between GSQL syntax V1 and V2.

GSQL has three syntax versions: V3, V2, and V1 (legacy version).
In TigerGraph 3.5, the default syntax version was changed to V2.

//TODO
*NEED INFORMATION HERE ABOUT V3.*

This page provides a summary of the differences between all three syntax versions, as well as guidance on how to change your queries to V3.

== Differences between V1, V2, and V3

The two tables below summarize the differences between versions.

Most of the syntactical differences between V1 and V2 lie in the `FROM` clause of the `SELECT` statement.
Therefore, Table 1 specifically lays out the differences in the `FROM` clause.
Other differences are summarized in Table 2.

.Differences in the `FROM` clause
|===
|Feature|V1 |V2 |V3

|Step vs path pattern
a|
The keyword `FROM` is followed by a 1-hop step.
Supports 1-hop only.

For more information, see xref:select-statement/select-statement-v1.adoc#_from_clause[`FROM` clause (V1)].
a|
The keyword `FROM` is followed by a xref:select-statement/index.adoc#_path_pattern[path pattern].
The path pattern may consist of multiple hops and allows for powerful xref:tutorials:pattern-matching/multiple-hop-and-accumulation.adoc[pattern matching].

//TODO

|Edge notation
|Edges in a step can optionally have a right arrowhead outside the parentheses.
For example:
`Start:s -( Edges:e )-> Target:t` or `Start:s -( Edges:e )- Target:t`
|No arrowheads are allowed outside the parentheses.
If an edge type is directed, the edge notation must have arrowheads inside the parentheses to indicate direction.
For example:
`Person:s-(STUDY_AT>:e)-University:t`

//TODO
|

|Traversal direction
|The traversal action is from left to right, and the notation uses either a rightward facing arrowhead or no arrowhead to depict a connection.
|The traversal direction is under the control of the query writer, with arrowheads on each edge set to show the direction.

//TODO
|
|Source vertex set
|The source vertex set in a step in the `FROM` clause must be xref:declaration-and-assignment-statements.adoc#_vertex_set_variables[a vertex set (seed set)] declared earlier in the query.
|The xref:select-statement/index.adoc#_source_vertex_set[source vertex set path pattern] in `FROM` clause can be a vertex set, a vertex type, or use `_` or `ANY` to indicate any vertex.

|===

.Other differences
|===
|Feature |V1 |V2 |V3

|xref:select-statement/index.adoc#_post_accum_clause[`POST-ACCUM` clause]
a|* Each `SELECT` statement can only have 1 `POST-ACCUM` clause.
* A `POST-ACCUM` clause may have statements that reference both source and target vertex aliases.
a|
* Each `SELECT` statement can have multiple `POST-ACCUM` clauses.
* Each `POST-ACCUM` clause must bind itself with one vertex alias.
This can be done explicitly or implicitly.

//TODO
|


|xref:select-statement/sql-like-select-statement.adoc[SQL-like `SELECT` statement]
|Not supported.
|Supported.

//TODO
|

|Data modification statements
|`FROM` clause can only perform one hop, which is the same as in the `SELECT` statement in V1.
|`FROM` clause can only perform one hop, even though it may perform multiple hops in the `SELECT` statement.

== Changing a query from V1 to V2
This section provides you with instructions to convert a V1 query into a V2 query.

GSQL can detect the syntax version of the query automatically, so there is no need to modify your queries from V1 to V2.

. Delete, move, or add arrowheads in the `FROM` clause.
+
--
* If the edge is undirected, delete the arrowhead outside parentheses in the `FROM` clause.
** For example `Source:s -(Friend:e)-> :t` becomes `Source:s -(Friend:e)- :t`
* If the edge is directed, move the arrowheads into the parentheses after the edge type.
If there is no arrowhead, you must add one after the edge type.
** For example, `Source:s -(Is_Located_In:e)-> :t` becomes `Source:s -(Is_Located_In>:e)- :t`
--
This is the most common incompatibility issue between a query written in V1 and V2.
Most V1 queries can run smoothly in V2 after the arrowheads are deleted.
. Check for `POST-ACCUM` clauses that aren't bound to one vertex alias or are bound to more than one vertex alias.
* In V2, every `POST-ACCUM` clause must reference one vertex alias.
If your V1 query has a `POST-ACCUM` clause that reference multiple vertex aliases, you need to break the `POST-ACCUM` clause into multiple `POST-ACCUM` clauses, with each clause referencing one vertex alias only.

Since a `SELECT` statement can only perform one hop in V1, you may have had to write multiple `SELECT` statements in order to write a multi-hop query.
With pattern matching in V2, you may choose to rewrite the query to use a single `SELECT` statement to perform multiple hops.

== Changing a query from V1 or V2 to V3
This section provides instructions to convert your query to a V3 query.

Here is some information about how GSQL interacts with V3 queries.

Here are some steps to do so:

. here is step one
** here is a bullet point
. here is step two

. here is step three



`here is some code`

--
And voila, your query is now in V3.
