= Minus Operator for Vertex Sets

The `MINUS` operator in GSQL is used to return the difference between two vertex sets. It essentially subtracts one vertex set from the other, returning only the vertices that are present in the first vertex set but not in the second.

USE GRAPH financialGraph

CREATE OR REPLACE QUERY minusTest () {
  S1 = SELECT s
       FROM (Phone):s
       WHERE s.number == "111" OR s.number == "222";

  //show what's in S1
  PRINT S1[S1.number];

  S2 = SELECT s
       FROM (Phone):s
       WHERE s.number == "222";

  //show what's in S2
  PRINT S2[S2.number];

  S3 = S1 MINUS S2;

  //show what's in S3
  PRINT S3[S3.number];

}

In the above example:

* S1 stores the vertex ids of phones “111” and “222”.
* S2 stores the vertex id of phone “222”.
* S3 stores the vertex id set of the elements of S1 subtacted by the elements of S2, which is {“111”}.
* `PRINT vertex_set_var[vertex_set_var.attribute]` will output the selected vertex attributes for each element bound to the vertex set variable.
