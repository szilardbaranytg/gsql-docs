= min()

The reducer function `min()` aggregates all values corresponding to the same ID and returns the minimum value.

== Syntax

`REDUCE( min (arg) )`

== Accepted parameter types

This function only accepts parameters that can be interpreted as a numeric type.

== Return value

`INT`, `UINT`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`: minimum of all arg values cumulatively received

== Example

If we have the following data in a CSV file of the different scores of test takers, and we want to load the lowest score to an attribute of the vertex:


|===
|name |score

|Tommy
|95

|Tommy
|93

|Tommy
|92

|Amy
|85

|Amy
|94

|Amy
|99
|===

We can use write the following load statement to use the `min()` reduce function to load the minimum of the scores matching each vertex ID.

[,gsql]
----
LOAD f TO VERTEX Person
  VALUES ($"name", REDUCE(min($"score"))
----

After loading, Tommy has a `score` attribute of 92 and Amy has a `score` attribute of 85.
