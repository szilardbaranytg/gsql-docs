= to_float()

Converts the string token to a float.
This is a token function for the `WHERE` clause of a `LOAD` statement only.
It cannot be used in a destination clause.

This function is necessary when you need to filter floating point values during loading, as all tokens are treated as strings.

== Syntax

`to_float( token )`

== Return value

`FLOAT`.
The floating point value converted from integers.

== Example

If we have the following data in a CSV file of the different scores of test takers, and we want to load a record if their score is higher than 95.5:


|===
|name |score

|Tommy
|94.3

|Amy
|95.9

|Amy
|93.1
|===

[,gsql]
----
LOAD f TO VERTEX Person
  VALUES ($"name", $"score")
  WHERE to_float($"score") > 95.5
----

After loading, only the second row in the provided data is loaded, as it is the only record where the score is greater than 95.
