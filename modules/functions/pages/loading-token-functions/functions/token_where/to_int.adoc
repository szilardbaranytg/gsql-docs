= to_int()

Converts the string token to an integer.
This is a token function for the `WHERE` clause of a `LOAD` statement only.
It cannot be used in a destination clause.

This function is necessary when you need to filter integer values during loading, as all tokens are treated as strings.

== Syntax

`to_int( token )`

== Return value

`INT`.
The integer converted from the input token.

== Example

If we have the following data in a CSV file of the different scores of test takers, and we want to load a record if their score is higher than 95:


|===
|name |score

|Tommy
|95

|Amy
|99

|Amy
|93
|===

[,gsql]
----
LOAD f TO VERTEX Person
  VALUES ($"name", $"score")
  WHERE to_int($"score") > 95
----

After loading, only the second row in the provided data is loaded, as it is the only record where the score is greater than 95.
